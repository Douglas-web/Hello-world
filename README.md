Hello world this is douglas first time on Github. learning how to use it haha.

I got interested in coding in december when my wife introduced it to me. 
I didn't think anything of it until I took a dive and I love it!
I'm still in the beginning haven't really learned javascript all to much but, I believe I'll get there.
